# Joint spatio-temporal disease mapping with INLA

In this repository you will find the `R` code to fit with INLA the models
described in this paper:

*Bayesian joint spatio-temporal analysis of multiple diseases*

Virgilio Gómez-Rubio, F. Palmí-Perales, G. López-Abente, R. Ramis-Prieto and
P. Fernández-Navarro

Included files are:

* `joint_st_dismap_sim_data.RData`: simulated data and spatial and temporal adjacency structure.

* `st_model_INLA.R`: `R` code to fit the joint spatio-temporal model.
